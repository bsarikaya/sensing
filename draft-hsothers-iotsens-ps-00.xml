<section anchor="introduction"><name>Introduction</name>

<t>Future networking to make full use of 5G capabilities or even
resembling an evolution to beyond 5G will have to exploit a much
more heterogeneous environment in terms of network and device
connectivity technologies and applications.  In addition ease of use
for customers and human-independent operation of a multitude of
devices and machines (things) has to be provided.</t>

<t>Therefore current authentication models like 802.1X <xref target="IEEE802.1X"/> which
are based on human intervention do not fit well.  Also this model
does not scale well for the Internet of
Things (IoT).  What we need is hardware based admission model.  Such
a model will enable many new applications as we explain more in this
document.</t>

<t>IEEE 802.11 <xref target="IEEE802.11"/> has a project on Wireless LAN (WLAN sensing)
and 802.11bf task group (TG) in charge of this project <xref target="BFSFD"/>.
Use cases for 802.11bf TG includes room sensing, i.e., presence
detection, counting the number of people in the room, localization of
active people, audio with user detection, gesture recognition at
different ranges, device proximity detection, home appliance control.
There are also health care related use cases like breathing/heart rate
detection, surveillance of persons of interest, building a 3D picture
of an environment, in car sensing for driver sleepiness detection
<xref target="BFUseCases"/>.</t>

<t>Hardware based authentication that we address in this document builds
on similar use cases.
We can summarize the use cases we are currently considering here:
Authenticating the device that is playing a melody, or a person has
just touched; authenticating devices, i.e. smart teapot with certain
manifests, like blinking red and blue; authenticate the device when a
camera is pointed at it; and the like <xref target="Henning"/>.
802.11bf sensing project provides proper framework for hardware based
authentication because 802.11 or Wi-Fi devices are more and more
diverse spanning from personal computers, smartphones, televisions,
tablets and all sorts of IoT devices or sensors.</t>

<t>TGbf is also working on Specification Framework Document with an
outline of each the functional blocks that will be a part of the final
amendment like wireless LAN sensing procedure <xref target="BFSFD"/>.
TGbf sensing is based on obtaining physical Channel State Information
(CSI) measurements between a transmitter and receiver WLAN nodes,
called stations (STA). Using these measurements, presence of obstacles
between a transmitter and receiver can be detected and tracked. This
way, using feature extraction and classification of artificial
intelligence (AI), more higher level tasks like human activity
recognition and object detection are available for authentication
purposes, while hardware based authentication use cases can be
achieved through computation of phase differences, etc.</t>

<t>TGbf Wi-Fi Sensing (SENS) is achieved by signaling between just an
initiator and a responder.
TGbf may also define more effective collaborative SENS (in short,
CSENS) where multiple SENS-enabled devices can collaborate as a group
in an orderly fashion to capture additional information about the
surrounding environment <xref target="Rest21"/>.</t>

described in BCP 14 <xref target="RFC2119"/> <xref target="RFC8174"/> when, and only when, they
appear in all capitals, as shown here.</t>

<t>Sensing (SENS) is defined as the usage of received Wi-Fi signals from
a Station (STA) to detect features (i.e., range, velocity, angular,
motion, presence or proximity, gesture, etc.) of intended targets
(i.e., object, human, animal, etc.) in a given environment (i.e.,
house, office, room, vehicle, enterprise, etc.).</t>

<t>Collaborative sensing (CSENS) defines the operation in which multiple
SENS enabled devices can collaborate as a group in an orderly fashion
to capture additional information about the surrounding environment
and allow for more precise detection thus enabling a more reliable
authentication.</t>

<t>Multi-band sensing is defined as sensing using both sub-7-GHz Channel
State Information (CSI) measurements that provide indication of
relatively large motions and that can propagate through obstacles
(e.g., walls) and 60-GHz Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI)
measurements at mmWave that provide highly-directional information
through the usage of beamforming toward a given receiver, but have
small range due to the presence of blockers (e.g., walls).</t>

</section>
<section anchor="hardware-based-authentication"><name>Hardware Based Authentication</name>

<t>Aim of this document is to lay ground for the need for new
authentication models in the framework of devices (e.g., machines in
IoT communication) within a (wireless or wireline-based)
network. Currently employed authentication models (such as e.g.,
802.1X certificate model) is based on a human being using the machine
and providing credentials (e.g., user name/password or a permitted
digital certificate) to the authenticator. Similarly, for user
equipment (UE) to access a cellular network the device has to be
equipped with a USIM and the user has to provide a secret key, i.e.,
PIN (Personal Identification Number).
With the use case of massive IoT (mIoT) as foreseen, e.g., in 5G and
with an increasing amount of devices within a household (smart home)
and/or in the ownership of a customer (smart watch etc.)
the need for an ease-of-use hardware-based admission model arises.</t>

<t>Focusing on corresponding procedures starting with detection (sensing)
of a new device and subsequent mutual authenticating of the device by
and to the network a set of potential technologies are identified and
described to allow for analysis in terms of criteria as reliable
operation (working), scalability, ease of use and convenience,
security, and many more.
Sensing is critical to Hardware Based Authentication because sensing 
(together with intelligent interpretation using possibly neural network models) will allow the detection of the device playing a melody, blinking red and blue,
 being pointed at, or somebody just touched and the like.
Furthermore, the method should be applicable to future generations of
network and of users, upcoming new applications and devices, assuming
that todays established standard procedures do not fulfill the
requirements sufficiently.</t>

<t>Hardware based authentication should leverage collaborative and
multi-band sensing technologies to enable sensing with much higher
precision and capacity using the state-of-art equipment. Also equally
important is the use of all artificial intelligence and neural
networks research results developed by the academia.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="solutions"><name>State of the Academic Approaches to IoT Authentication</name>

<t>A detailed review on current topics in IoT Security, Device Authentication
and Access Control was provided in <xref target="Inayat"/>. 
The following list of literature on sensor data and WiFi sensing for
securing and authenticating a user and a device shows the wide range
of approaches and interest in this topic <xref target="Rest21"/>.</t>

<t><xref target="Ma"/>, <xref target="Wang"/>, <xref target="Zhu"/>, <xref target="Wang2"/>, and <xref target="Qian"/> provide a holistic overview
on the evolution of Wi-Fi technology and on investigations in
opportunistic applications of Wi-Fi signals for gesture and motion
detection.</t>

<t><xref target="Henning2"/> is investigating geospatial access control for IoT. There are 
attribute, role and identity based, time based and geospatial access control 
techniques. Real-world IoT access control policies will be a combination of all
 three, leading to powerful access control techniques to use in practice such as
 in university campus. Such access control or authorization techniques will 
likely be used in conjunction with Hardware Based Authentication.</t>

<t>Other notable literature includes <xref target="Al-Qaness"/> on the so-called
device-free CSI-based Wi-Fi sensing mechanism, <xref target="Pahlavan"/> using Wi-Fi
signals for gesture and motion detection as well as for authentication
and security, <xref target="Lui"/> distinguishing between Line-of-Sight (LOS) and
Non-Line-of-Sight (NLOS) conditions in case of obstacles appearing
between the transmitter and the receiver <xref target="Guo"/> studying HuAc (Human
Activity Recognition) as a combination of WiFi-based and Kinect-based
activity recognition system, <xref target="FURQAN"/> analyzing the wireless sensing
and radio environment awareness mechanisms, highlighting their
vulnerabilities such as dependency of sensing modes on external
signals, and provides solutions for mitigating them, e.g., the
different threats to REM (radio environment mapping) and its
consequences in a vehicular communication scenario.</t>

<t><xref target="Ma2"/> has studied reliable SENS algorithm for human and animal
identification.
The aim is to make it resilient to spoofing and adverse channel
conditions, i.e., presence of noise and interference from other
technologies.</t>

<t><xref target="Restuccia"/> investigates data driven algorithms, neural networks,
especially convolutional neural network (CNN) or digital signal
processing (DSP) block to classify complex sensing phenomena.
Also <xref target="Liao"/> and <xref target="Liao2"/> proposed to enhance security of industrial
wireless sensor networks (IWSNs) by neural network based algorithms
for sensor nodes' authentication and implementations in IWSNs have
shown that an improved convolution preprocessing neural network
(CPNN)-based algorithm requires few computing resources and has
extremely low latency, thus enabling a lightweight multi-node
PHY-layer authentication.</t>

<t>Further research on these and similar issues can be found in <xref target="Tian"/>,
<xref target="Bai"/>, and <xref target="Axente"/>.</t>

<section anchor="iot"><name>IoT Authentication Protocols</name>

<t>Since IoT applications cover a broad range of domains from smart
cities, industry, and homes to personal (e.g., wearable) devices,
including security and privacy sensitive areas as e-health, and can
reach a huge number of entities the security requirements in terms of
preventing unauthorized access to data are very high.
Therefore very robust authentication mechanisms have to be applied.
At the same time depending on the specific scenario a trade-off
between resources as processing power and memory and security protocol
complexity has to be considered.
Also a plethora of attack scenarios has to be in focus as well as
scalability of the considered implicit and explicit hardware- and
software-based authentication procedures.
<xref target="RFC8576"/> serves as a reference for details about IoT specific
security considerations including the area of authentication and
documents their specific security challenges, threat models, and
possible mitigations.
Also the OAuth <xref target="RFC6749"></xref> protocol is referred to which extends traditional client-server authentication by
providing a third party client with a token instead of allowing it to
use the resource owner's credentials to access protected resources
while such token resembles a different set of credentials than those
of the resource owner.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="nextgen"><name>Hardware IoT Authentication Problem</name>

<t>Most of the state-of-art hardware identification techniques to
authenticate the user use finger prints a.k.a. touch id and facial
identification and they use detection by hardware i.e. touch,
accelerometer, and gyro sensors or cameras.
They are based on creating a signature, or the user's already stored
password <xref target="Wang3"/>.</t>

<t>On the other hand to authenticate a device based on a set of
characteristic parameters which should be flexibly chosen by the owner
and subsequently made known to the authentication system will require
a certain level of processing and storage capacity either within the
local system components (e.g., the device itself and the wireless
point of attachment or access point) and/or within the network (e.g.,
an edge cloud instance or a central data base).
The result of the detection process (e.g., radio wave analysis outcome
in terms of parameters as modulation scheme, number of carriers, and
fingerprinting) has to be compared with the required (correct)
parameter values which are safely stored within the network
components.
On all levels of handling these data, i.e., storage, processing, and
transport via a communication network, the integrity of the content
has to be preserved.
One should keep in mind, that any unintended authentication request
should be prevented to minimize the risk of occasional attachment to 
networks and subsequent exposure to attack to sensitive user data.</t>

<section anchor="IPwork"><name>Architectural and Procedural Issues for Future IP-based IoT-Authentication</name>

<t>Here we will discuss possible solutions on IP level and identify
benefits and potential gaps towards the requirements of next
generation IoT systems.
On IP or network layer for IPv6 IPsec protocol suite is mandatory and
provides end-to-end security for authentication procedures, ensuring
confidentiality and integrity of the transmitted data.
Authentication for IoT may rely on a protocol as 6LowPAN (Low-power
Wireless Personal Area Network) which is deﬁned for optimizing the
efficient routing of IPv6 packets for resource constrained machine-
type communication applications.</t>

<t>When compared to a fully certificate-based authentication, however, a
hardware-based AAA mechanism relying e.g., on WiFi sensing gesture
detection does not require the user to know any key, identifier, or
password for the device to be authenticated.  A pre-defined type of access
to the device (e.g., physical, photographic or video representation,
unique description in terms of parameters, etc.) shall be sufficient for
authentication.</t>

<t><xref target="RFC8995"></xref> on ‘Bootstrapping Remote Secure Key Infrastructure’ (BRSKI) deals 
with authentication of devices, including sending authorizations to the 
device as to what network they should join, and how to authenticate that 
network by specifying automated bootstrapping of an Autonomic Control Plane (ACP).
Secure Key Infrastructure (SKI) bootstrapping using manufacturer-installed X.509
certificates combined with a manufacturer's authorizing service, both online and
offline, is called the Bootstrapping Remote Secure Key Infrastructure (BRSKI)
protocol.  Bootstrapping a new device can occur when using a routable address 
and a cloud service, only link-local connectivity, or limited/disconnected networks
and includes support for deployment models with less stringent security requirements.
When the cryptographic identity of the new SKI is successfully deployed to the
device, completion of bootstrapping is achieved. A locally issued certificate can
be deployed to the device via the established secure connection as well.</t>

<abstract><t>The Internet of Things (IoT) concept refers to the usage of standard Internet protocols to allow for human-to-thing and thing-to-thing communication.  The security needs for IoT systems are well recognized, and many standardization steps to provide security have been taken -- for example, the specification of the Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) secured with Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS).  However, security challenges still exist, not only because there are some use cases that lack a suitable solution, but also because many IoT devices and systems have been designed and deployed with very limited security capabilities.  In this document, we first discuss the various stages in the lifecycle of a thing. Next, we document the security threats to a thing and the challenges that one might face to protect against these threats.  Lastly, we discuss the next steps needed to facilitate the deployment of secure IoT systems.  This document can be used by implementers and authors of IoT specifications as a reference for details about security considerations while documenting their specific security challenges, threat models, and mitigations.</t><t>This document is a product of the IRTF Thing-to-Thing Research Group (T2TRG).</t></abstract>
