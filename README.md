# In view of expected evolution towards future networking of a multitude of things connected via heterogeneous technologies to the internet new means for authentication in a human-independent manner has to be provided.
# Sensing, e.g., in terms of detection of gestures or shapes to identify authorised devices and apply hardware-based authentication will contribute to ease of use, but peresumably raise new security and privacy concerns.
# The planned document shall describe the problem statement for hardware based Internet of Things (IoT) authentication as a future networking area beyond 5G towards the relationship with Wireless Local Area Network collaborative and/or multi-band sensing and identify  challenges and gaps which demand for continuation of recent research efforts in the area.

#We will generate an IETF I-D collaboratively and eventually submit it
