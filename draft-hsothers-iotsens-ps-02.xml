    <abstract>


<t>The document attempts to establish the need for new authentication methods in the Internet of Things (IoT)
as a future
networking area beyond
5G going into 6G for standardization. Several scenarios are described where the current 
authentication protocols do not work or are insufficient. 
Wireless LAN/6G sensing is established as an admission method that can be used within the framework of
Device Provisioning Protocol and LED light 
and others as out-of band channel based authentication which can be further explored.</t>

<section anchor="introduction"><name>Introduction</name>

<t>Future networking to make full use of 5G capabilities or even
resembling an evolution to beyond 5G will have to exploit a much
more heterogeneous environment in terms of network and device
connectivity technologies and applications.  In addition, ease of use
for customers and human-independent operation of a multitude of
devices and machines (things) has to be provided.</t>

<t>Therefore current authentication models like 802.1X <xref target="IEEE802.1X"/> which
are based on human intervention do not fit well.  Also this model
does not scale well for the Internet of
Things (IoT).</t>

<t>Device Provisioning Protocol (DPP) developed by Wi-Fi Alliance makes it possible that IoT 
devices with Wi-Fi interface can be 
bootstrapped and authenticated using another device such as a mobile phone <xref target="dpp"/>.
DPP uses different out-of band channels to get authentication information from the device
such as Bluetooth, Near-Field Communications (NFC), QR code, etc.</t>

<t>The idea of using a mobile phone for IoT authentication also opens up the possibility of 
better methods of admission and makes it possible to realize the use cases 
such as:
Authenticating the device that is playing a melody, or a person has
just touched; authenticating devices, i.e. smart teapot with certain
manifests, like blinking red and blue; authenticate the device when a
camera is pointed at it; and the like <xref target="Henning"/>.
Advances in signal processing may make it possible to realize these and similar use cases.
Here, we will mention Wi-Fi sensing activity that is being taken up by IEEE 802.11.</t>

<t>Detection and interpretation of audio signals by microphones and corresponding                <br />
software has been under investigation since some time and                     <br />
can be achieved with high precision nowadays.
Coding of haptic information is currently under standardisation at IEEE P.1918 <xref target="P1918"/>.                     <br />
Using an         objects' position to grant authentication could be achieved via geometrical information                      <br />
(as e.g., position and orientation of a trusted device like the camera) or via radio sensing.</t>

<t>IEEE 802.11 has a project on Wireless LAN (WLAN sensing) and 802.11bf
task group (TG) in charge of this project <xref target="BFSFD"/>.
Use cases for 802.11bf TG includes room sensing, i.e., presence
detection, counting the number of people in the room, localization of
active people, audio with user detection, gesture recognition at
different ranges, device proximity detection, home appliance control.
There are also health care related use cases like breathing/heart rate
detection, surveillance of persons of interest, building a 3D picture
of an environment, in car sensing for driver sleepiness detection
<xref target="BFUseCases"/>.</t>

<t>TGbf is also working on Specification Framework Document with an
outline of each the functional blocks that will be a part of the final
amendment like wireless LAN sensing procedure <xref target="BFSFD"/>.
TGbf sensing is based on obtaining physical Channel State Information
(CSI) measurements between a transmitter and receiver WLAN nodes,
called stations (STA). Using these measurements, presence of obstacles
between a transmitter and receiver can be detected and tracked. This
way, using feature extraction and classification of artificial
intelligence (AI), more higher level tasks like human activity
recognition and object detection are available for authentication
purposes, while corresponding authentication context information  can be
obtained through computation of phase differences, etc.</t>

<t>TGbf Wi-Fi Sensing (SENS) is achieved by signaling between just an
initiator and a responder.
TGbf may also define more effective collaborative SENS (in short,
CSENS) where multiple SENS-enabled devices can collaborate as a group
in an orderly fashion to capture additional information about the
surrounding environment <xref target="Rest21"/>.</t>

<t>While Wi-Fi sensing may lead to higher levels of admission methods for IoT devices there is
a need to communicate with the device for authentication. 
Just like in Device Provisioning Protocol, there is a need to use out-of band channels
to provide two independent channels     to allow for secure Two-Factor Authentication (TFA/2FA).
These issues will be exploited further in the following sections.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="conventions-and-terminology"><name>Conventions and Terminology</name>

<t>The key words "<bcp14>MUST</bcp14>", "<bcp14>MUST NOT</bcp14>", "<bcp14>REQUIRED</bcp14>", "<bcp14>SHALL</bcp14>", "<bcp14>SHALL

described in BCPÂ 14 <xref target="RFC2119"/> <xref target="RFC8174"/> when, and only when, they
appear in all capitals, as shown here.</t>

<t>Sensing (SENS) is defined as the usage of received Wi-Fi signals from
a Station (STA) to detect features (i.e., range, velocity, angular,
motion, presence or proximity, gesture, etc.) of intended targets
(i.e., object, human, animal, etc.) in a given environment (i.e.,
house, office, room, vehicle, enterprise, etc.).</t>

<t>Collaborative sensing (CSENS) defines the operation in which multiple
SENS enabled devices can collaborate as a group in an orderly fashion
to capture additional information about the surrounding environment
and allow for more precise detection thus enabling a more reliable
authentication.</t>

<t>Multi-band sensing is defined as sensing using both sub-7-GHz Channel
State Information (CSI) measurements that provide indication of
relatively large motions and that can propagate through obstacles
(e.g., walls) and 60-GHz Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI)
measurements at mmWave that provide highly-directional information
through the usage of beam forming toward a given receiver, but have
small range due to the presence of blockers (e.g., walls).</t>

</section>
<section anchor="sensing-in-device-provisioning-protocol"><name>Sensing in Device Provisioning Protocol</name>

<t>Aim of this document is to lay ground for the need for new
authentication models in the framework of devices (e.g., machines in
IoT communication) within a (wireless or wireline-based)
network. Currently employed authentication models (such as e.g.,
802.1X certificate model) is based on a human being using the machine
and providing credentials (e.g., user name/password or a permitted
digital certificate) to the authenticator. Similarly, for user
equipment (UE) to access a cellular network the device has to be
equipped with a USIM and the user has to provide a secret key, i.e.,
PIN (Personal Identification Number).
With the use case of massive IoT (mIoT) as foreseen, e.g., in 5G and
with an increasing amount of devices within a household (smart home)
and/or in the ownership of a customer (smart watch etc.)
the need for an ease-of-use  admission model arises.</t>

<t>Focusing on corresponding procedures starting with detection (sensing)
of a new device to admit it in the local network and subsequent mutual authentication of the device by
and to the network, a set of potential technologies are identified and
described to allow for analysis in terms of criteria as reliable
operation (working), scalability, ease of use and convenience,
security, and many more.</t>

<t>Most of the state-of-art  identification/admission techniques to
authenticate the user use finger prints a.k.a. touch id and facial
identification and they use detection by  touch,
accelerometer, and gyro sensors or cameras.
They are based on creating a signature, or the user's already stored
password <xref target="Wang3"/>.
Sensing<br />
(together with intelligent interpretation using possibly neural network models) will allow 
the detection of the device playing a melody, blinking red and blue,
 being pointed at, or somebody just touched and the like.</t>

<t>Sensing provides a natural extension to the Device Provisioning Protocol as a new technique 
for admission of an IoT device 
to the local network.
So since it is able to cover a 
 wide range of use cases possibly applicable to future generations of
network and of users, upcoming new applications and devices, sensing presents itself as 
 the preferable admission protocol.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="iot"><name>IoT Authentication Protocols</name>

<t>Since IoT applications cover a broad range of domains from smart
cities, industry, and homes to personal (e.g., wearable) devices,
including security and privacy sensitive areas as e-health, and can
reach a huge number of entities the security requirements in terms of
preventing unauthorized access to data are very high.
Therefore very robust authentication mechanisms have to be applied.
At the same time depending on the specific scenario a trade-off
between resources as processing power and memory and security protocol
complexity has to be considered.
Also a plethora of attack scenarios has to be in focus as well as
scalability of the considered implicit and explicit hardware- and
software-based authentication procedures.
<xref target="RFC8576"/> serves as a reference for details about IoT specific
security considerations including the area of authentication and
documents their specific security challenges, threat models, and
possible mitigations.
Also the OAuth <xref target="RFC6749"/> protocol is referred to which extends traditional 
client-server authentication by
providing a third party client with a token instead of allowing it to
use the resource owner's credentials to access protected resources
while such token resembles a different set of credentials than those
of the resource owner.</t>

<t>On the other hand to authenticate a device based on a set of
characteristic parameters which should be flexibly chosen by the owner
and subsequently made known to the authentication system will require
a certain level of processing and storage capacity either within the
local system components (e.g., the device itself and the wireless
point of attachment or access point) and/or within the network (e.g.,
an edge cloud instance or a central data base).
The result of the detection process (e.g., radio wave analysis outcome
in terms of parameters as modulation scheme, number of carriers, and
fingerprinting) has to be compared with the required (correct)
parameter values which are safely stored within the network
components.
On all levels of handling these data, i.e., storage, processing, and
transport via a communication network, the integrity of the content
has to be preserved.
One should keep in mind, that any unintended authentication request
should be prevented to minimize the risk of occasional attachment to 
networks and subsequent exposure to attack to sensitive user data.</t>

<section anchor="autonomic-control-plane-and-out-of-band-channel-usage-in-iot-authentication"><name>Autonomic Control Plane and Out-of Band Channel Usage in IoT Authentication</name>

<t>Authentication for IoT may rely on a protocol such as 6LowPAN (Low-power
Wireless Personal Area Network) which is defined for optimizing the
efficient routing of IPv6 packets for resource constrained machine-
type communication applications.</t>

<t><xref target="RFC8995"/> on âBootstrapping Remote Secure Key Infrastructureâ (BRSKI)
deals with authentication of devices, including sending authorizations to
the device as to what network they should join, and how to authenticate
that network by specifying automated bootstrapping of an Autonomic
Control Plane (ACP) <xref target="RFC8994"/>.
Secure Key Infrastructure (SKI) bootstrapping using manufacturer-
installed X.509 certificates combined with a manufacturer's authorizing
service, both online and offline, is called the Bootstrapping Remote
Secure Key Infrastructure (BRSKI) protocol.  Bootstrapping a new device
can occur when using a routable address and a cloud service, only link-
local connectivity, or limited/disconnected networks and includes support
for deployment models with less stringent security requirements.  When
the cryptographic identity of the new SKI is successfully deployed to the
device, completion of bootstrapping is achieved.  A locally issued
certificate can be deployed to the device via the established secure
connection as well.</t>

<t>DPP is based on the usage of out-of band channel usage. LED light so far appeared to be 
the most commonly used out-of band channel. Here we describe two projects, the lighthouse and
EAP-NOOB.</t>

<t>LED light based authentication attempts to authenticate hard to reach IoT devices using 
LED light indicator available on the device. Here LED light is used as an out-of-band 
channel in addition to a wireless LAN peer-to-peer connection to the device using a 
smartphone over TLS connection which is not secured. Smartphone initially obtains deviceâs
 public key certificate.  Smartphone as the client requests certificate fingerprint over 
 visible LED light channel. Device transmits fingerprint by modulating LED. Client 
 receives data with camera and decodes. Client compares TLS certificate fingerprint with 
 received fingerprint to complete authentication. LED light based authentication does not
  support multiple ways of getting the hash value from the device. Although most devices 
  have LED type of output leading to visible light communication, some devices have 
  speaker type of output  and not readily visible <xref target="Lins18"/>, <xref target="Oden18"/>.</t>

<t>LED light based authentication is similar to EAP-NOOB, Nimble out-of-band 
authentication for EAP <xref target="RFC9140"/> where Zigbee or 802.15.4 channel is the main channel 
and blinking LED light  is used as out-of-band channel. In the main channel, the device is 
connected to the Internet over 802.15.4 channel to a controller (a laptop, acting as 
a Wi-Fi access point) which connects over the Internet to AAA server as EAP server 
where the user has an account. In the OOB channel, the device is connected to a 
smartphone using blinking LED light and the smartphone is connected to AAA server using 
its 4G/5G air interface. OOB channel enables the device to send critical data needed i.e.
 a secret nonce to EAP server. EAP-NOOB protocol architecture includes RADIUS which is 
 used to encode EAP messages and constrained Application Protocol, CoAP which is a 
 simplified HTTP. CoAP is used in transporting the nonce. EAP-NOOB requires 
 AAA server and user account on the server, i.e. human interaction.</t>

<t>When compared to the above out-of band channel use in IoT authentication 
 a mechanism relying on Wi-Fi sensing gesture
detection does not require the user to know any key, identifier, or
password for the device to be authenticated.  A pre-defined type of access
to the device (e.g., physical, photographic or video representation,
unique description in terms of parameters, etc.) shall be a prerequisite for
authentication.
In addition, no second interface at     the IoT device would be required beyond the radio 
signal which can be     used for both, communication and the OOB transmission of the secret.</t>

</section>
</section>
<section anchor="the-need-for-new-authentication-models"><name>The Need for New Authentication Models</name>

<t>LED light is one-directional initiated by the sensor. The advantages of LED light as out-of 
band channel is that LED light is readily available in every smartphone and 
LED light has some good security properties, because of visibility, man-in-the middle 
attacks can be easily mitigated.</t>

<t>While OOB channel is universal, i.e. it can apply to any type of IoT device
not all devices have a light or are visible.
For for future work, we need to think of multiple ways to do authentication, not just one, 
even for the same
device. Some devices will have speakers, for example, or may not be readily visible.</t>

<section anchor="iot-applications-commonly-used"><name>IoT Applications Commonly Used</name>

<t>There are many IoT applications for home usage that enable authentication as well as 
configuration of the devices such as Homekit. Device vendor like Feit Electric also make 
similar applications.
These apps have a common problem: when a device, like a light bulb goes bad, there is no 
easy way to remove it from all the features like groups, scenes, automations that the bulb
 was part of. The main issue is the lack of search/replace one device with another.
 This brings the need for naming IoT devices. A standard geospatial naming needs to be 
 developed so that the  developers can use it in developing their IoT applications.</t>

<abstract><t>The Internet of Things (IoT) concept refers to the usage of standard Internet protocols to allow for human-to-thing and thing-to-thing communication.  The security needs for IoT systems are well recognized, and many standardization steps to provide security have been taken -- for example, the specification of the Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) secured with Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS).  However, security challenges still exist, not only because there are some use cases that lack a suitable solution, but also because many IoT devices and systems have been designed and deployed with very limited security capabilities.  In this document, we first discuss the various stages in the lifecycle of a thing. Next, we document the security threats to a thing and the challenges that one might face to protect against these threats.  Lastly, we discuss the next steps needed to facilitate the deployment of secure IoT systems.
