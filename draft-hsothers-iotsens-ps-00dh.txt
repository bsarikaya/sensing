1.  Introduction

   Future networking to make full use of 5G capabilities or even
   resembling an evolution to beyond 5G will have to exploit a much more
   heterogeneous environment in terms of network and device connectivity
   technologies and applications.  In addition ease of use for customers
   and human-independent operation of a multitude of devices and
   machines (things) has to be provided.

   Therefore current authentication models like 802.1X [IEEE802.1X]
   which are based on human intervention do not fit well.  Also this
   model does not scale well for the Internet of Things (IoT).  What we
   need is hardware based admission model.  Such a model will enable
   many new applications as we explain more in this document.

   IEEE 802.11 has a project on Wireless LAN (WLAN sensing) and 802.11bf
   task group (TG) in charge of this project [BFSFD].  Use cases for
   802.11bf TG includes room sensing, i.e., presence detection, counting
   the number of people in the room, localization of active people,
   audio with user detection, gesture recognition at different ranges,
   device proximity detection, home appliance control.  There are also
   health care related use cases like breathing/heart rate detection,
   surveillance of persons of interest, building a 3D picture of an
   environment, in car sensing for driver sleepiness detection
   [BFUseCases].

Internet-Draft        IoT Sensing Problem Statement       September 2021


   Hardware based authentication that we address in this document builds
   on similar use cases.  We can summarize the use cases we are
   currently considering here: Authenticating the device that is playing
   a melody, or a person has just touched; authenticating devices, i.e.
   smart teapot with certain manifests, like blinking red and blue;
   authenticate the device when a camera is pointed at it; and the like
   [Henning].  802.11bf sensing project provides proper framework for
   hardware based authentication because 802.11 or Wi-Fi devices are
   more and more diverse spanning from personal computers, smartphones,
   televisions, tablets and all sorts of IoT devices or sensors.

   TGbf is also working on Specification Framework Document with an
   outline of each the functional blocks that will be a part of the
   final amendment like wireless LAN sensing procedure [BFSFD].  TGbf
   sensing is based on obtaining physical Channel State Information
   (CSI) measurements between a transmitter and receiver WLAN nodes,
   called stations (STA).  Using these measurements, presence of
   obstacles between a transmitter and receiver can be detected and
   tracked.  This way, using feature extraction and classification of
   artificial intelligence (AI), more higher level tasks like human
   activity recognition and object detection are available for
   authentication purposes, while hardware based authentication use
   cases can be achieved through computation of phase differences, etc.

   TGbf Wi-Fi Sensing (SENS) is achieved by signaling between just an
   initiator and a responder.  TGbf may also define more effective
   collaborative SENS (in short, CSENS) where multiple SENS-enabled
   devices can collaborate as a group in an orderly fashion to capture
   additional information about the surrounding environment [Rest21].

2.  Conventions and Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

   Sensing (SENS) is defined as the usage of received Wi-Fi signals from
   a Station (STA) to detect features (i.e., range, velocity, angular,
   motion, presence or proximity, gesture, etc.) of intended targets
   (i.e., object, human, animal, etc.) in a given environment (i.e.,
   house, office, room, vehicle, enterprise, etc.).

   Collaborative sensing (CSENS) defines the operation in which multiple
   SENS enabled devices can collaborate as a group in an orderly fashion
   to capture additional information about the surrounding environment
   and allow for more precise detection thus enabling a more reliable
   authentication.

Internet-Draft        IoT Sensing Problem Statement       September 2021


   Multi-band sensing is defined as sensing using both sub-7-GHz Channel
   State Information (CSI) measurements that provide indication of
   relatively large motions and that can propagate through obstacles
   (e.g., walls) and 60-GHz Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI)
   measurements at mmWave that provide highly-directional information
   through the usage of beamforming toward a given receiver, but have
   small range due to the presence of blockers (e.g., walls).

3.  Hardware Based Authentication

   Aim of this document is to lay ground for the need for new
   authentication models in the framework of devices (e.g., machines in
   IoT communication) within a (wireless or wireline-based) network.
   Currently employed authentication models (such as e.g., 802.1X
   certificate model) is based on a human being using the machine and
   providing credentials (e.g., user name/password or a permitted
   digital certificate) to the authenticator.  Similarly, for user
   equipment (UE) to access a cellular network the device has to be
   equipped with a USIM and the user has to provide a secret key, i.e.,
   PIN (Personal Identification Number).  With the use case of massive
   IoT (mIoT) as foreseen, e.g., in 5G and with an increasing amount of
   devices within a household (smart home) and/or in the ownership of a
   customer (smart watch etc.) the need for an ease-of-use hardware-
   based admission model arises.

   Focusing on corresponding procedures starting with detection
   (sensing) of a new device and subsequent mutual authenticating of the
   device by and to the network a set of potential technologies are
   identified and described to allow for analysis in terms of criteria
   as reliable operation (working), scalability, ease of use and
   convenience, security, and many more.  Furthermore, the method should
   be applicable to future generations of network and of users, upcoming
   new applications and devices, assuming that todays established
   standard procedures do not fulfill the requirements sufficiently.

   Hardware based authentication should leverage collaborative and
   multi-band sensing technologies to enable sensing with much higher
   precision and capacity using the state-of-art equipment.  Also
   equally important is the use of all artificial intelligence and
   neural networks research results developed by the academia.

4.  State of the Academic Approaches to IoT Authentication

   The following list of literature on sensor data and WiFi sensing for
   securing and authenticating a user and a device shows the wide range
   of approaches and interest in this topic [Rest21].

Internet-Draft        IoT Sensing Problem Statement       September 2021


   [Ma], [Wang], [Zhu], [Wang2], [Qian] provide a holistic overview on
   the evolution of Wi-Fi technology and on investigations in
   opportunistic applications of Wi-Fi signals for gesture and motion
   detection.

   Other notable literature includes [Al-Qaness] on the so-called
   device-free CSI-based Wi-Fi sensing mechanism, [Pahlavan] using Wi-Fi
   signals for gesture and motion detection as well as for
   authentication and security, [Lui] distinguishing between Line-of-
   Sight (LOS) and Non-Line-of-Sight (NLOS) conditions in case of
   obstacles appearing between the transmitter and the receiver [Guo]
   studying HuAc (Human Activity Recognition) as a combination of WiFi-
   based and Kinect-based activity recognition system, [FURQAN]
   analyzing the wireless sensing and radio environment awareness
   mechanisms, highlighting their vulnerabilities such as dependency of
   sensing modes on external signals, and provides solutions for
   mitigating them, e.g., the different threats to REM (radio
   environment mapping) and its consequences in a vehicular
   communication scenario.

   [Ma2] has studied reliable SENS algorithm for human and animal
   identification.  The aim is to make it resilient to spoofing and
   adverse channel conditions, i.e., presence of noise and interference
   from other technologies.

   [Restuccia] investigates data driven algorithms, neural networks,
   especially convolutional neural network (CNN) or digital signal
   processing (DSP) block to classify complex sensing phenomena.  Also
   [Liao] and [Liao2] proposed to enhance security of industrial
   wireless sensor networks (IWSNs) by neural network based algorithms
   for sensor nodes' authentication and implementations in IWSNs have
   shown that an improved convolution preprocessing neural network
   (CPNN)-based algorithm requires few computing resources and has
   extremely low latency, thus enabling a lightweight multi-node PHY-
   layer authentication.

   Further research on these and similar issues can be found in [Tian],
   [Bai] [Axente].

5.  IoT Authentication Protocols

   Since IoT applications cover a broad range of domains from smart
   cities, industry, and homes to personal (e.g., wearable) devices,
   including security and privacy sensitive areas as e-health, and can
   reach a huge number of entities the security requirements in terms of
   preventing unauthorized access to data are very high.  Therefore very
   robust authentication mechanisms have to be applied.  At the same
   time depending on the specific scenario a trade-off between resources

   as processing power and memory and security protocol complexity has
   to be considered.  Also a plethora of attack scenarios has to be in
   focus as well as scalability of the considered implicit and explicit
   hardware- and software-based authentication procedures.  [RFC8576]
   serves as a reference for details about IoT specific security
   considerations including t he area of authentication and documents
   their specific security challenges, threat models, and possible
   mitigations.  [to be continued]

6.  Hardware IoT Authentication Problem

   Most of the state-of-art hardware identification techniques to
   authenticate the user use finger prints a.k.a. touch id and facial
   identification and they use detection by hardware i.e. touch,
   accelerometer, and gyro sensors or cameras.  They are based on
   creating a signature, or the user's already stored password [Wang3].

   On the other hand to authenticate a device based on a set of
   characteristic parameters which should be flexibly chosen by the
   owner and subsequently made known to the authentication system will
   require a certain level of processing and storage capacity either
   within the local system components (e.g., the device itself and the
   wireless point of attachment or access point) and/or within the
   network (e.g., an edge cloud instance or a central data base).  The
   result of the detection process (e.g., radio wave analysis outcome in
   terms of parameters as modulation scheme, number of carriers, and
   fingerprinting) has to be compared with the required (correct)
   parameter values which are safely stored within the network
   components.  On all levels of handling these data, i.e., storage,
   processing, and transport via a communication network, the integrity
   of the content has to be preserved.

6.1.  Architectural and Procedural Issues for Future IP-based IoT-
      Authentication

   Here we will discuss possible solutions on IP level and identify
   benefits and potential gaps towards the requirements of next
   generation IoT systems.

7.  IANA Considerations

   TBD.

8.  Security Considerations

   This document raises no new security concerns but tries to identify
   how to increase security in future IoT by discussing the issues of
   robust but easy to apply authentication mechanisms.
