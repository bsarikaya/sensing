1.  Introduction

   Future networking to make full use of 5G capabilities or even
   resembling an evolution to beyond 5G will have to exploit a much more
   heterogeneous environment in terms of network and device connectivity
   technologies and applications.  In addition ease of use for customers
   and human-independent operation of a multitude of devices and
   machines (things) has to be provided.

   Therefore current authentication models like 802.1X [IEEE802.1X]
   which are based on human intervention do not fit well.  Also this
   model does not scale well for the Internet of Things (IoT).  What we
   need is hardware based admission model.  Such a model will enable
   many new applications as we explain more in this document.

   IEEE 802.11 [IEEE802.11] has a project on Wireless LAN (WLAN sensing)
   and 802.11bf task group (TGbf) in charge of this project [BFSFD].  Use
   cases for 802.11bf TG includes room sensing, i.e., presence
   detection, counting the number of people in the room, localization of
   active people, audio with user detection, gesture recognition at
   different ranges, device proximity detection, home appliance control.
   There are also health care related use cases like breathing/heart
   rate detection, surveillance of persons of interest, building a 3D
   picture of an environment, in car sensing for driver sleepiness
   detection [BFUseCases].

   Hardware based authentication that we address in this document builds
   on similar use cases.  We can summarize the use cases we are
   currently considering here: Authenticating the device that is playing
   a melody, or a person has just touched; authenticating devices, i.e.
   smart teapot with certain manifests, like blinking red and blue;
   authenticate the device when a camera is pointed at it; and the like
   [Henning].  802.11bf sensing project provides proper framework for
   hardware based authentication because 802.11 or Wi-Fi devices are
   more and more diverse spanning from personal computers, smartphones,
   televisions, tablets and all sorts of IoT devices or sensors, including
   passengers and drivers in vehicles and other road users which have to
   exchange traffic messages, e.g., for safety and efficiency reasons (see
   ITS, Intelligent Traffic Systems].

   TGbf Wi-Fi Sensing (SENS) is achieved by signaling between just an
   initiator and a responder.  TGbf may also define more effective
   collaborative SENS (in short, CSENS) where multiple SENS-enabled
   devices can collaborate as a group in an orderly fashion to capture
   additional information about the surrounding environment [Rest21].

2.  Conventions and Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

   Sensing (SENS) is defined as the usage of received Wi-Fi signals from
   a Station (STA) to detect features (i.e., range, velocity, angular,
   motion, presence or proximity, gesture, etc.) of intended targets
   (i.e., object, human, animal, etc.) in a given environment (i.e.,
   house, office, room, vehicle, enterprise, etc.).

   Collaborative sensing (CSENS) defines the operation in which multiple
   SENS enabled devices can collaborate as a group in an orderly fashion
   to capture additional information about the surrounding environment
   and allow for more precise detection thus enabling a more reliable
   authentication.

3.  Hardware Based Authentication

   Aim of this document is to lay ground for for new
   authentication models in the framework of devices (e.g., machines in
   IoT communication) within a (wireless or wireline-based) network.
   Currently employed authentication models (such as e.g., 802.1X
   certificate model) are based on a human using the machine and
   providing credentials (e.g., user name/password or a permitted
   digital certificate) to the authenticator.  Similarly, for user
   equipment (UE) to access a cellular network the device has to be
   equipped with a USIM and the user has to provide a secret key, i.e.,
   PIN (Personal Identification Number).  With the use case of massive
   IoT (mIoT) as foreseen, e.g., in 5G and with an increasing amount of
   devices within a household (smart home) and/or in the ownership of a
   customer (smart watch etc.) the need for an ease-of-use hardware-
   based admission model is apparent.

   Focusing on corresponding procedures starting with detection
   (sensing) of a new device and subsequent mutual authenticating of the
   device by and to the network a set of potential technologies are
   identified and described to allow for analysis in terms of criteria
   as reliable operation (working), scalability, ease of use and
   convenience, security, and many more.  Furthermore, the method should
   be extensible and future safe, to enable new applications and devices.

   Hardware based authentication may leverage collaborative and
   multi-band sensing technologies as well as AI algorithms to enable
   sensing with high precision and capacity using the state-of-art
   equipment.

4.  State of the Academic Approaches to IoT Authentication

   The following list of literature on sensor data and WiFi sensing for
   securing and authenticating a user and a device shows the wide range
   of approaches and interest in this topic [Rest21].

Internet-Draft        IoT Sensing Problem Statement       September 2021


   [Ma], [Wang], [Zhu], [Wang2], [Qian] provide a holistic overview on
   the evolution of Wi-Fi technology and on investigations in
   opportunistic applications of Wi-Fi signals for gesture and motion
   detection.

   Other notable literature includes [Al-Qaness] on the so-called
   device-free CSI-based Wi-Fi sensing mechanism, [Pahlavan] using Wi-Fi
   signals for gesture and motion detection as well as for
   authentication and security, [Liu] distinguishing between Line-of-
   Sight (LOS) and Non-Line-of-Sight (NLOS) conditions in case of
   obstacles appearing between the transmitter and the receiver [Guo]
   studying HuAc (Human Activity Recognition) as a combination of WiFi-
   based and Kinect-based activity recognition system, [FURQAN]
   analyzing the wireless sensing and radio environment awareness
   mechanisms, highlighting their vulnerabilities such as dependency of
   sensing modes on external signals, and provides solutions for
   mitigating them, e.g., the different threats to REM (radio
   environment mapping) and its consequences in a vehicular
   communication scenario.

   [Ma2] has studied reliable SENS algorithm for human and animal
   identification.  The aim is to make it resilient to spoofing and
   adverse channel conditions, i.e., presence of noise and interference
   from other technologies.

   [Restuccia] investigates data driven algorithms, neural networks,
   especially convolutional neural network (CNN) or digital signal
   processing (DSP) block to classify complex sensing phenomena.  Also
   [Liao] and [Liao2] proposed to enhance security of industrial
   wireless sensor networks (IWSNs) by neural network based algorithms
   for sensor nodes' authentication and implementations in IWSNs have
   shown that an improved convolution preprocessing neural network
   (CPNN)-based algorithm requires few computing resources and has
   extremely low latency, thus enabling a lightweight multi-node PHY-
   layer authentication.

   Further research on these and similar issues can be found in [Tian],
   [Bai] [Axente].

5.  IoT Authentication Protocols

   Since IoT applications cover a broad range of domains from smart
   cities, industry, and homes to personal (e.g., wearable) devices,
   including security and privacy sensitive areas as e-health, and can
   reach a huge number of entities the security requirements in terms of
   preventing unauthorized access to data are very high.  Therefore very
   robust authentication mechanisms have to be applied.  At the same
   time depending on the specific scenario a trade-off between resources

Internet-Draft        IoT Sensing Problem Statement       September 2021


   as processing power and memory and security protocol complexity has
   to be considered.  In addition, a plethora of attack scenarios has to
   be considered and scalability of the considered implicit and explicit
   hardware- and software-based authentication procedures needs to be
   taken into account.  [RFC8576] serves as a reference for details about
   IoT specific security considerations including the area of
   authentication and documents their specific security challenges,
   threat models, and possible mitigations.  [to be continued]

6.  Hardware IoT Authentication Problem

   Most of the state-of-art hardware identification techniques to
   authenticate the user use finger prints a.k.a. touch id and facial
   identification and they use detection by hardware i.e. touch,
   accelerometer, and gyro sensors or cameras.  They are based on
   creating a signature, or the user's already stored password [Wang3].

   On the other hand to authenticate a device based on a set of
   characteristic parameters which should be flexibly chosen by the
   owner and subsequently made known to the authentication system will
   require a certain level of processing and storage capacity either
   within the local system components (e.g., the device itself and the
   wireless point of attachment or access point) and/or within the
   network (e.g., an edge cloud instance or a central data base).  The
   result of the detection process (e.g., radio wave analysis outcome in
   terms of parameters as modulation scheme, number of carriers, and
   fingerprinting) has to be compared with the required (correct)
   parameter values which are safely stored within the network
   components.  On all levels of handling these data, i.e., storage,
   processing, and transport via a communication network, the integrity
   of the content has to be preserved.
   
   One should keep in mind, that any unintended authentication request
   should be prevented to minimize the risk of occasional attachment to 
   networks and subsequent exposure to attack to sensitive user data.

6.1.  Architectural and Procedural Issues for Future IP-based IoT-
      Authentication

   Here we will discuss possible solutions on IP level and identify
   benefits and potential gaps towards the requirements of next
   generation IoT systems.
   On IP or network layer for IPv6 IPsec protocol suite is mandatory and
   provides end-to-end security for authentication procedures, ensuring
   confidentiality and integrity of the transmitted data.
   Authentication for IoT may rely on a protocol as 6LowPAN (Low-power
   Wireless Personal Area Network) which is deﬁned for optimizing the
   efficient routing of IPv6 packets for resource constrained machine-
   type communication applications.

   Any exchange of authentication messages between a device attaching to a
   Network access point (AP) as WiFi AP and the responsible backend server
   for Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting (AAA) may be depicted 
   as shown in Figure 1.

   When compared to a fully certificate-based authentication, however, a
   hardware-based AAA mechanism relying e.g., on WiFi sensing gesture
   detection does not require the user to know any key, identifier, or
   password for the device to be authenticated.  A pre-defined type of access
   to the device (e.g., physical, photographic or video representation,
   unique description in terms of parameters, etc.) shall be sufficient for
   authentication.

   Similar to what the Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) providing an
   authentication framework supporting multiple authentication methods we try
   to generalize an AAA over any layer not requiring pre-authentication.  


   IoT device        WiFi Sensing AP       AAA Client         AAA-Server
        |                   |                   |                  |       
        |<---- token -----> |                   |                  | 
        |                   |<- identity data ->|                  |
        |                   |                   |-- AAA Request -->|
        |                   |                   |<- AAA-Response --|
       
      Figure 1: Schematic representation of Authentication procedure

   The AAA method is intended for authenticating all kind of Internet-of-
   Things (IoT) devices without any pre-configured authentication
   Credentials by making use of a general token created in a mutual agreed
   method making use of a user-assisted or -unassisted detection process.
   The exemplary WiFi sensing client at the AP recognizes the device and
   the attached authentication client contacts the AAA server for the
   authentication request/response exchange.  
  
   [RFC8995] on ‘Bootstrapping Remote Secure Key Infrastructure’ (BRSKI)
   deals with authentication of devices, including sending authorizations to
   the device as to what network they should join, and how to authenticate
   that network by specifying automated bootstrapping of an Autonomic
   Control Plane (ACP).
   Secure Key Infrastructure (SKI) bootstrapping using manufacturer-
   installed X.509 certificates combined with a manufacturer's authorizing
   service, both online and offline, is called the Bootstrapping Remote
   Secure Key Infrastructure (BRSKI) protocol.  Bootstrapping a new device
   can occur when using a routable address and a cloud service, only link-
   local connectivity, or limited/disconnected networks and includes support
   for deployment models with less stringent security requirements.  When
   the cryptographic identity of the new SKI is successfully deployed to the
   device, completion of bootstrapping is achieved.  A locally issued
   certificate can be deployed to the device via the established secure
   connection as well.
   
   [draft-richardson-anima-masa-considerations] (expired) on Operational
   Considerations for Voucher infrastructure for BRSKI MASA describes and
   defines several operational modes that a BRSKI Manufacturer Authorized
   Signing Authority (MASA) may take on.  Each mode is assessed in terms of
   relevance and applicability per type of organization the MASA is deployed
   into.  The document is mostly about IDevID (Initial Device Identifier)
   and other related trust anchors such that devices can later be
   authenticated.

   [draft-richardson-t2trg-idevid-considerations] on a taxonomy of
   operational security of manufacturer installed keys and anchors is
   dealing with how the PKI used for above can be evaluated.

   [draft-richardson-anima-registrar-considerations] (expired) on
   Operational Considerations for BRSKI Registrar describes how an
   operator builds and manages the infrastructure to authenticate devices.

   [draft-irtf-t2trg-secure-bootstrapping-00] on ‘Secure IoT Bootstrapping:
   A Survey’ provides an overview of the various terms that are used when
   discussing bootstrapping of IoT devices and presents an overview of
   secure bootstrapping mechanisms available for smart objects that are part
   of an Internet of Things (IoT) network in terms of different options to
   choose from, depending on their use-case, security requirements, and the
   user interface available on their IoT devices.

   [draft-ietf-emu-eap-noob-06] on Nimble out-of-band authentication for EAP
   (EAP-NOOB) defines both an authentication method and key derivation.  The
   EAP method is intended for bootstrapping all kinds of Internet-of-Things
   (IoT) devices that have no pre-configured authentication credentials.

   Today, most vertically integrated systems deploy static keys to the devices
   to authenticate the "cloud" service to the IoT device.  Whether or not they
   authenticate the device at all is often unknown without an NDA.


7.  IANA Considerations

   TBD.

8.  Security Considerations

   This document raises no new security concerns but tries to identify
   how to increase security in future IoT by discussing the issues of
   robust but easy to apply authentication mechanisms.
